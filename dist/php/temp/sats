Definitive studies will be made of the abundances of essentially all isotopes from H to Zn (Z = 1-30), with exploratory isotope studies extending to Zr (Z = 40). The ACE payload includes six high resolution spectrometers, each designed to provide the optimum charge, mass, or charge-state resolution in its particular energy range. Each spectrometer has a geometry factor optimized for the expected flux levels, so as to provide a collecting power greater by a factor of 10-1000 times that of previous or planned experiments. The payload also includes three additional instruments of standard design to monitor energetic electrons, H and He ions, and a magnetometer. The ACE spacecraft is based on the design of the Charge Composition Explorer, built at JHU\/APL for the Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer (AMPTE) program. The spacecraft spin axis is pointed towards the Sun to within +\/- 20 degrees, and it occupies a halo orbit about the L1 Earth-Sun libration point.

AKEBONO\u2019s objective is to investigate the magnetospheric phenomena associated with the acceleration process of aurora particles. Aurora is a luminous phenomenon that occurs when solar-wind particles trapped in the magnetosphere collide with Earth\u2019s atmospheric particles. A better understanding of this phenomenon will help us understand the physical processes taking place in the Sun and the reaction on Earth. AKEBONO observes these physical processes to create a greater understanding of the structure of the magnetosphere and the flow and momentum of energy from the Sun through the geospace.  AKEBONO is an ambitious satellite carrying a number of \"world-first\" technologies. AKEBONO carries eight sets of instruments for scientific observation. It also has a radiation monitor, and anti-radiation technology that has been applied to a satellite for the first time in the world. This technology provides protection against radiation, even in the near-Earth radiation belt, as it is designed to tolerate about ten times the intensity withstood by conventional satellites. Other world-first technology applied to AKEBONO includes an extension mast for antenna and surface electrical conduction processing, to gain better conductivity and protection from charged particles. The GEOTAIL and NOZOMI satellites have inherited these technologies. GEOTAIL operates in the world-best quiet environment, which has never before been possible without the electromagnetic compatibility test conducted by AKEBONO.  The AKEBONO has operated for more than 20 years. Although the aurora imager camera has deteriorated due to the severe radioactive environment, all the other instruments are in good order. The direction of the major magnetic field of the Sun is known to reverse in a 22-year cycle. The Sun\u2019s activeness, which is typically measured by the number of sunspots, increases and decreases twice in this 22-year cycle. In other words, the Sun\u2019s behavior is changing in an 11-year cycle. To study the response of the magnetosphere to various activities of the Sun, we need to acquire data for 22 years. The AKEBONO will, therefore, continue its observations.

FAST investigates the plasma physics of auroral phenomena at extremely high time and spatial resolution using the full complement of particle and fields instruments. FAST is the second spacecraft (SAMPEX was first) in the Small Explorer (SMEX) program at NASA-GSFC. SMEX was established to provide rapid (3 year development) low cost ($35M development) mission opportunities (1 per year) to the space science community using a single designated Principal Investigator (PI).\n\nIn order to capture the auroral phenomena over small time (microseconds) and spatial scales, FAST utilizes high speed data sampling, a large, fast-loading (\"burst\") memory, and a smart, on-board software to trigger on the appearance of various key phenomena. Using a 1 Gb solid-state memory and a data acquisition rate of 8 Mbs (almost two orders of magnitude faster than previous satellites), FAST produces high-resolution \"snapshots\" of auroral arcs and other interesting auroral events. FAST flies in a highly eccentric, near-polar orbit precessing nominally one degree per day. Scientific investigations are operate in a campaign mode (about 60 days long) as apogee transitions through the northern auroral zone and in less intense survey mode during the rest of the orbit.\n\nThe FAST mission uses a unique (not a SAMPEX derivative), lightweight, orbit-normal spinner spacecraft developed by the SMEX project. The spacecraft has body-mounted solar arrays, and is spin-stabilized, rotating at 12 rpm with the spin axis normal to the orbit plane (\"cartwheel\"). The four FAST experiments are: (1) the Electrostatic Analyzers (ESA) for measuring the electron and ion distribution function, (2) the Time-of-flight Energy Angle Mass Spectrograph (TEAMS) for measuring the full 3-dimensional distribution function of the major ion species, (3) the Tri-Axial Fluxgate and Search-coil Magnetometers for measuring magnetic field data, and (4) the Electric Field\/Langmuir Probe Instrument for obtaining electric field data and plasma density and temperature. The FAST electric field instrument stopped providing meaningful data around 2002, all other instruments and systems continue to function nominally."},"date":"08-22-1996","pos":[4871.495322022563414066098630428314208984375,4327.350949004447102197445929050445556640625,1899.402047027898106534848921000957489013671875]},{"name":"FIREBIRD 3","id":"firebird3","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"01-31-2015","pos":[814.08945217728114585042931139469146728515625,-2230.5971012171803522505797445774078369140625,-6385.54488008269618148915469646453857421875]},{"name":"FIREBIRD 4","id":"firebird4","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"01-31-2015","pos":[-782.4219360910909699668991379439830780029296875,-5503.248269910081944544799625873565673828125,-3975.499728547076301765628159046173095703125]},{"name":"GCOM-W1","id":"gcomw1","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"05-17-2012","pos":[-5860.438649173223893740214407444000244140625,-2893.8542320222250054939649999141693115234375,-2741.175284786660995450802147388458251953125]},{"name":"Geotail","id":"geotail","infos":{"norad":"GTL","country":"NASA-Office of Space Science (United States)","discipline":"Space Physics","mass":"\u00a0550.0\u00a0kg","description":"The solar wind draws the Earth's magnetic field into a long tail on the nightside of the Earth and stores energy in the stretched field lines of the magnetotail. During active periods, the tail couples with the near-Earth magnetosphere, sometimes releasing energy stored in the tail and activating auroras in the polar ionosphere.\n            The Geotail mission measures global energy flow and transformation in the magnetotail to increase understanding of fundamental magnetospheric processes. This includes the physics of the magnetopause magnetospheric boundary regions, the lobe and plasma sheet, and reconnection and neutral line formation, i.e., the mechanisms processes of input, transport, storage, release and conversion of mass, momentum and energy in the magnetotail.\n            Geotail, together with Wind, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster projects, constitute a cooperative scientific satellite project designated the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program which aims at gaining improved understanding of the physics of solar-terrestrial relations.\n            Geotail is a spin-stabilized spacecraft utilizing mechanically despun antennas with a design lifetime of about four years. The nominal spin rate of the spacecraft is about 20 rpm around a spin axis maintained between 85-89 degrees to the ecliptic plane. Geotail is cylindrical, approximately 2.2 m in diameter, and 1.6 m high. with It has body-mounted solar cells. Geotail also has and a back-up battery subsystem which that operates when the spacecraft is in the Earth's shadow (limited to 2 hrs). Real-time telemetry data transmitted in X-band are received at the Usuda Deep Space Center (UDSC) in Japan. There are two tape recorders on board, each with a capacity of 450 Mb, which allows daily 24-hour data coverage and are collected in playback mode by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n            The Geotail mission is divided into two phases. During the two-year initial phase, the orbit apogee was kept on the nightside of the Earth by using the Moon's gravity in a series of double-lunar swing-by maneuvers that result in the spacecraft spending most of its time in the distant magnetotail (maximum apogee about 200 Earth radii) with a period varying from one to four months. Then, in November 1994, there were a series of maneuvers that reduced the apogee to 50 Re. After three more months in the magnetotail the spacecraft was put in a 10 by 30 Re orbit where it has remained except that the perigee was reduced from 10 to 9 Re in June 1997.\n            Details on the Geotail mission and instrumentation are given in the Journal of Geomagnetism and Geoelectricity (Vol. 46, No. 1, 1994); online from JGG at http:\/\/www.terrapub.co.jp\/journals\/EPS\/JGG"},"date":"07-26-1992","pos":[15408.330815150302441907115280628204345703125,86441.436425921754562295973300933837890625,-46123.268320356146432459354400634765625]},{"name":"Geotail (2-year Predict)","id":"geotailpred","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"07-27-2016","pos":[15118.903326444591584731824696063995361328125,86373.48240414189058355987071990966796875,-46048.0249189859605394303798675537109375]},{"name":"GOES-13","id":"goes13","infos":{"norad":"2006-018A","country":"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (United States)","discipline":"Earth Science","mass":"\u00a0550.0\u00a0kg","description":"GOES 13 is an American (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) geostationary weather satellite that was launched by a Delta 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral at 22:11 UT on 24 May 2006.

Launched by the Titan II rocket from Vandenberg AFB, NOAA-K replaced the decommissioned NOAA 12 in an afternoon equator-crossing orbit. It provided support to environmental monitoring by complementing the NOAA\/NESS geostationary meteorological satellite program (GOES).

Imaging and collection of spectroscopic plasma diagnostics of the solar chromosphere, transition region and corona, as well as in situ solar-wind measurements are used to study the corona and solar wind. Solar interior structure is investigated by helioseismological means and by the observation of variations in solar irradiance. SOHO was part of the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics Program (ISTP).\n\nThe SOHO spacecraft was three-axis stabilized and pointed towards the Sun with an accuracy of +\/- 10 arcsec per 15 min. It consisted of a Payload Module to accommodate the instruments and a Service Module carrying the spacecraft subsystems and solar arrays. SOHO occupied a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrangian point to obtain uninterrupted sunlight. The design life was two years, but on-board consumables were sufficient for an extra four years of operations.\n\nTwelve instruments comprised the payload, producing a continuous stream of data at 40 kbs, except whenever the solar oscillations imager Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) was operated in high-bit-rate mode, producing 160 kbs. The high-bit-rate mode was used during scheduled daily eight-hour periods or during dedicated campaigns. Magnetic tape stored data between telemetry contacts with the Experiment Operations Facility, located at NASA-GSFC. For more information, see B. Fleck, V. Domingo, and A. I. Poland, eds., Solar Physics, V. 162, 1995.\n\nSOHO was a joint mission of the European Space Agency and NASA. It was launched aboard an Atlas IIAS rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Station, FL, on Dec. 2, 1995, and mission operations were directed from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.\n\nIn April 1998, SOHO successfully completed its nominal two-year mission to study the Sun's atmosphere, surface and interior. Major science highlights include the detection of rivers of plasma beneath the surface of the Sun; the discovery of a magnetic \"carpet\" on the solar surface that seems to account for a substantial part of the energy that is needed to cause the very high temperature of the corona, the Sun's outermost layer; the first detection of flare-induced solar quakes; the discovery of more than 50 sungrazing comets; the most detailed view to date of the solar atmosphere; and spectacular images and movies of coronal mass ejections, which were being used to improve the ability to forecast space weather.\n\nContact with SOHO was lost at 23:16 GMT on June 24, 1998 during maintenance operations. The spacecraft went into emergency sun reacquisition mode, which is activated when an anomaly occurs and the spacecraft loses its orientation toward the Sun. When this happened, the spacecraft automatically tried to point itself toward the Sun again by firing its attitude control thrusters under the guidance of an onboard Sun sensor. Efforts to re-establish contact with SOHO did not succeed and telemetry was lost, not to be reestablished for several weeks.\n\nAttitude analysis led to the conclusion that SOHO went into a spin such that the solar panels were nearly edge-on towards the Sun, and thus did not generate any power. Because the spin axis is fixed in space, as the spacecraft progressed in its orbit the orientation of the panels with respect to the Sun gradually changed, resulting in increased solar illumination of the solar arrays as time progressed. On August 3, contact was re-established with SOHO following six weeks of silence. After a lengthy recovery process, on September 16 the spacecraft again locked onto the Sun, and experiment heaters were switched on. After recommissioning of various subsystems, and an orbit correction maneuver, SOHO was finally brought back to normal mode on 25 September at 19:52:58 GMT. Instrument switch-on started October 5, 1998, and by November 4 all instruments were back to normal."},"date":"12-02-1995","pos":[1375408.60439022281207144260406494140625,660803.560992083395831286907196044921875,-2941.11594106095481038209982216358184814453125]},{"name":"SORCE","id":"sorce","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"01-30-2003","pos":[-4416.7661639943335103453136980533599853515625,-5425.230239092861665994860231876373291015625,121.92395086370328272096230648458003997802734375]},{"name":"Spitzer","id":"spitzer","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"09-01-2013","pos":[186441902.0649742782115936279296875,146408147.3834884464740753173828125,2282564.5123280403204262256622314453125]},{"name":"STEREO-Ahead","id":"stereoa","infos":{"norad":"STEREO East","country":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration (United States)","discipline":"Earth Science","mass":"\u00a0550.0\u00a0kg","description":"The Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission includes two spacecraft respectively lagging (STEREO A) and leading (STEREO B) the Earth in heliocentric orbit around the Sun for remote 3-D imaging and radio observations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

Real-time space weather data will be continuously transmitted through a separate beacon system to NASA and non-NASA receiving stations."},"date":"10-27-2006","pos":[260572382.718132674694061279296875,-117995785.74222029745578765869140625,-203163.73633635995793156325817108154296875]},{"name":"Sun","id":"sun","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"01-01-1959","pos":[149461950.3093417584896087646484375,-8923.378519333573422045446932315826416015625,-1711.41202814943608245812356472015380859375]},{"name":"Suomi NPP","id":"suomi","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"11-04-2011","pos":[3593.23186896937477285973727703094482421875,-75.7929570572547390838735736906528472900390625,-6252.5980505471407013828866183757781982421875]},{"name":"Swarm A","id":"swarma","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"11-26-2013","pos":[6743.6639403024382772855460643768310546875,876.3792615333150024525821208953857421875,-543.399603617122238574665971100330352783203125]},{"name":"Swarm B","id":"swarmb","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"11-26-2013","pos":[-715.8593792920033820337266661226749420166015625,-4867.84518617512003402225673198699951171875,4807.9665864279550078208558261394500732421875]},{"name":"Swarm C","id":"swarmc","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"11-26-2013","pos":[6714.8631576308698640787042677402496337890625,1013.66124520036237299791537225246429443359375,-651.16212799190770965651609003543853759765625]},{"name":"THEMIS-A (4-year Predict)","id":"themisapred","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"07-18-2008","pos":[-52927.203756413699011318385601043701171875,36696.6804540517114219255745410919189453125,-18909.4427360544432303868234157562255859375]},{"name":"THEMIS-B (4-year Predict)","id":"themisbpred","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"07-18-2008","pos":[251489.759763577603735029697418212890625,258505.095011610654182732105255126953125,-32710.63661612042415072210133075714111328125]},{"name":"THEMIS-C (4-year Predict)","id":"themiscpred","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"07-18-2008","pos":[241157.75394002455868758261203765869140625,246160.83980838526622392237186431884765625,-32517.5527601660505752079188823699951171875]},{"name":"THEMIS-D (4-year Predict)","id":"themisdpred","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"07-18-2008","pos":[-57598.304774298318079672753810882568359375,44003.0734434276455431245267391204833984375,-15601.0398837777393055148422718048095703125]},{"name":"THEMIS-E (4-year Predict)","id":"themisepred","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"07-18-2008","pos":[-58114.967518641278729774057865142822265625,35089.8389103978333878330886363983154296875,-13722.303383217096779844723641872406005859375]},{"name":"TIMED","id":"timed","infos":{"norad":"Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics","country":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration (United States)","discipline":"Earth Science","mass":"\u00a0550.0\u00a0kg","description":"The Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) mission was designed to study the physical and chemical processes acting within and upon the coupled mesosphere, lower-thermosphere\/ ionosphere system between about 60 and 180 km. TIMED investigates a region that is difficult to study because it is too high for even the largest research balloons and still dense enough to quickly cause a satellite to decay from orbit. Because of the lack of measurements this atmospheric region is often referred to as the \"ignorosphere\". Absorping a considerable amount of solar ultraviolet radiation from the sun and intercepting high energy atomic particles, this region is the \"skin\" between the life-sustaining lower layers and outer space. Originally proposed as a two-spacecraft mission, the TIMED project was rescoped to a one-satellite mission due to budgetary pressure. TIMED was downsized to a core mission of four experiments and six interdisciplinary investigations and mission management was moved to JHU-APL in an effort to reduce the cost to the $100M level. The instruments include the Solar EUV Experiment (SEE) provided by the University of Colorado, the TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI) provided by the University of Michigan, the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) provided by the Aerospace Corp., and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) provided by NASA's Langley Research Center. TIMED was launched together with Jason 1 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB on 7 December 2001. All instruments are fully operational, only the TIDI instrument is operating with somewhat decreased sensitivity because of a light leak and ice deposits on the instrument optics."},"date":"02-07-2002","pos":[1679.4539534796131192706525325775146484375,-6755.05712835049416753463447093963623046875,-604.9473010108735024914494715631008148193359375]},{"name":"Wind","id":"wind","infos":{"norad":"GGS\/Wind","country":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration (United States)","discipline":"Earth Science","mass":"\u00a0550.0\u00a0kg","description":"The Wind spacecraft was launched on November 1, 1994 and is the first of two NASA spacecraft in the Global Geospace Science initiative and part of the ISTP Project. The science objectives of the Wind mission are: (1) Provide complete plasma, energetic particle, and magnetic field input for magnetospheric and ionospheric studies; (2) Determine the magnetospheric output to interplanetary space in the up-stream region; (3) Investigate basic plasma processes occurring in the near-Earth solar wind; and (4) Provide baseline ecliptic plane observations to be used in heliospheric latitudes from ULYSSES.\n            Wind has on-board propulsion and its design lifetime is three to five years, with redundant subsystems. Wind is cylindrical, approximately 2.8 m in diameter by 1.25 m high, with body-mounted solar cells. It has long wire spin-plane antennas, inertial booms, and spin-plane appendages to support sensors. Wind has experiment booms deployed along both Z axes. The spin rate is 20 rpm around an axis within 1 degree of normal to the ecliptic.\n            Data are stored using on-board tape recorders and are relayed to the Deep Space Network at one of two rates: 5.5 or 11.1 kbps.\n            For the first nine months of operation, Wind was placed in a double-lunar swingby orbit near the ecliptic plane, with apogee from 80 to 250 Earth radii and perigee of between 5 and 10 Earth radii. In this orbit, lunar gravity assists were used to keep its apogee over the day hemisphere of the Earth, and magnetospheric observations are made. Wind was then inserted into a small \"halo\" orbit, about the sunward Sun-Earth gravitational equilibrium point (L1), varying from 235 to 265 Earth radii. In this orbit Wind measures the incoming solar wind, magnetic fields and particles continuously and provides an approximately one-hour warning to the other ISTP spacecraft of changes in the solar wind.\n            In 2001 and 2002 Wind has executed a distant prograde orbit that took it +\/- 300 Re leading and legging Earth. This orbit provided a wide baseline to study solar wind structures and correlations. In 2003, Wind reached the L2 Lagrange point 240 Re anti-sunward from Earth providing a 500 Re spatial separation from ACE solar wind observations along with measurements of the distant Earth magnetotail. Since 2004, Wind has been permanently parked in a L1 halo orbit where it continues to provide high-quality solar wind measurements."},"date":"11-16-1994","pos":[1615976.0434173564426600933074951171875,-365382.6797328745597042143344879150390625,86343.119973212349577806890010833740234375]},{"name":"XMM-Newton","id":"xmm","infos":"Pas de donn\u00e9es","date":"12-21-1999","pos":[-26375.1283838530871435068547725677490234375,-70630.395563101585139520466327667236328125,-72476.9184707429376430809497833251953125]}]
